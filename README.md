Bank Account Management System
This is a simple Java-based Bank Account Management System that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, check account balances, and view transaction histories. The system supports three types of bank accounts: Savings, Current, and Business. The account management is handled through a console-based menu system.

Features
Create Account: Allows users to create a new bank account with specified details such as account number, account holder name, account type, and initial deposit.
Deposit: Enables users to deposit money into their account.
Withdraw: Allows users to withdraw money from their account, subject to overdraft limits for Current and Business accounts and sufficient balance for Savings accounts.
Check Balance: Allows users to check their current account balance.
View Transaction History: Users can view a detailed history of all their transactions (deposits and withdrawals).
Account Types
Savings: Requires a minimum balance of â‚¹1000 and does not allow overdraft.
Current/Business: Requires a minimum balance of â‚¹5000 and supports an overdraft limit of â‚¹10,000.
Requirements
Java 8 or later.
No external libraries are required as this project uses only standard Java collections.

Code Structure
BankAccount.java: Defines the properties and methods related to an individual bank account, such as account number, holder, type, balance, and transaction history. It also includes methods for depositing, withdrawing, checking balance, and viewing transaction history.

BankingSystem.java: Contains the main logic for interacting with the user. It displays the menu, accepts user input, and calls the appropriate methods from the BankAccount class to perform actions.

Notes
The system assumes that the user enters valid inputs. Further input validation can be added to improve the robustness of the system.
The overdraft limit for Current and Business accounts is â‚¹10,000, which means the account can go into a negative balance up to â‚¹10,000.
